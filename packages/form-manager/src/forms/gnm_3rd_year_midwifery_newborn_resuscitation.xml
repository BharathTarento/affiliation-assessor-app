Dry the baby, remove the wet cloth, and wrap the baby in a dry, warm cloth.
Place the baby on its back on a clean, warm surface and keep covered except for the face and chest.</label><item><label>Done</label><value>done</value></item><item><label>Not Done</label><value>not</value></item></select1><select1 appearance="list-nolabel" ref="/data/intro/step2"><label>RESUSCITATION USING BAG AND MASK
Position the head in a slightly extended position to open the airway
Clear the airway by suctioning the mouth first and then the nose:
-Introduce catheter into the baby's mouth and suction while withdrawing catheter;
-Introduce catheter into each nostril and suction while withdrawing catheter;
-Be especially thorough with suctioning if there is blood or meconium in the baby's mouth and/or nose;
If the baby is still not breathing after the airway has been suctioned, start ventilating
Quickly recheck the position of the baby's head to make sure that the neck is slightly extended
Place the mask on the baby's face so that it covers the chin, mouth and nose to form a seal (size 1 mask for normal weight newborn and size 0 for a small newborn)
Squeeze the bag with two fingers only or with the whole hand, depending on the size of the bag
Check the seal by ventilating two or three times and observing the rise of the chest.
If the baby's chest is rising:
Ventilate at a rate of 40 breaths per minute.
If the baby's chest is not rising:
-Repeat suction of mouth and nose to remove mucus, blood or meconium from the airway;
-Check the position of the head again to make sure the neck is slightly extended;
-Reposition the mask on the baby's face to improve the seal between mask and face;
Squeeze the bag with the whole hand to increase ventilation pressure.
Ventilate for 1 minute, using oxygen, if available, and then stop and quickly assess the baby for spontaneous breathing and color:
-If breathing is normal (30–60 breaths per minute), stop ventilating and place the baby in skin-to-skin contact with the mother;
-If there is central cyanosis (blue tongue and lips), chest indrawing, grunting on expiration, or respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute, treat the baby for breathing difficulty;
If the baby is gasping, not breathing, or the respiratory rate is less than 20 breaths per minute, continue ventilating.
If the baby starts crying, stop ventilating and observe the baby's respiratory rate for five minutes after crying stops:
If breathing is normal (30–60 breaths per minute), stop ventilating;
If there is central cyanosis (blue tongue and lips), chest indrawing, grunting on expiration, or respiratory rate is 20 to 30 breaths per minute, treat the baby for breathing difficulty;
If the baby is gasping, not breathing, or the respiratory rate is less than 20 breaths per minute, continue ventilating
If the baby is not breathing regularly after 20 minutes of ventilation:
-Continue ventilation with oxygen;
Organize transfer and refer baby to a tertiary care centre, if possible
If there is no gasping or breathing at all after 20 minutes of ventilation, stop ventilating:

Soak suction catheters in 0.5% chlorine solution for 10 minutes for decontamination.
Wipe exposed surfaces of the bag and mask with a gauze pad soaked in 60-90% alcohol or 0.5% chlorine solution and rinse immediately. 
Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry with a clean, dry cloth (or air dry).
