Breast milk contains exactly the nutrients a baby needs
-is easily digested and efficiently used by the baby's body
-protects a baby against infection
Babies should start breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth. They should not have any other food or drink before they start to breastfeed
Babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life.

Breastfeeding
-helps baby's development and mother/baby attachment
-can help delay a new pregnancy</label><item><label>Done</label><value>done</value></item><item><label>Not Done</label><value>not</value></item></select1><select1 appearance="list-nolabel" ref="/data/intro/step2"><label>Help the mother to initiate breastfeeding
within 1 hour, when baby is ready
After birth, let the baby rest comfortably on the mother's chest in skin-to-skin contact.
Tell the mother to help the baby to her breast when the baby seems to be ready, usually within the first hour. Signs of readiness to breastfeed are:
-baby looking around/moving
-mouth open
-searching.
Check that position and attachment are correct at the first feed. Offer to help the mother at any time
Let the baby release the breast by her/himself; then offer the second breast
If the baby does not feed in 1 hour, examine the baby. If healthy, leave the baby with the mother to try later. Assess in 3 hours, or earlier if the baby is small
If the mother is ill and unable to breastfeed, help her to express breast milk and feed the baby by
cup. On day 1 express in a spoon and feed by spoon.
If mother cannot breastfeed at all, use one of the following options:
-donated heat-treated breast milk.
-If not available, then commercial infant formula.
-If not available, then home-made formula from modified animal milk.</label><item><label>Done</label><value>done</value></item><item><label>Not Done</label><value>not</value></item></select1><select1 appearance="list-nolabel" ref="/data/intro/step3"><label>Support exclusive breastfeeding
Keep the mother and baby together in bed or within easy reach. DO NOT separate them
Encourage breastfeeding on demand, day and night, as long as the baby wants.
A baby needs to feed day and night, 8 or more times in 24 hours from birth. Only on the first day may a full-term baby sleep many hours after a good feed.
 A small baby should be encouraged to feed, day and night, at least 8 times in 24 hours from birth.
 Help the mother whenever she wants, and especially if she is a first time or adolescent mother
Let baby release the breast, then offer the second breast
 If the mother must be absent, let her express breast milk and let somebody else feed the expressed breast milk to the baby by cup.
DO NOT force the baby to take the breast.
DO NOT interrupt feed before baby wants.
DO NOT give any other feeds or water.
DO NOT use artificial teats or pacifiers.
Advise the mother on medication and breastfeeding
-Most drugs given to the mother in this guide are safe and the baby can be breastfed.
-If mother is taking cotrimoxazole or fansidar, monitor baby for jaundice</label><item><label>Done</label><value>done</value></item><item><label>Not Done</label><value>not</value></item></select1><select1 appearance="list-nolabel" ref="/data/intro/step4"><label>Teach correct positioning and attachmentfor breastfeeding
Show the mother how to hold her baby. She should:
-make sure the baby's head and body are in a straight line
-make sure the baby is facing the breast, the baby's nose is opposite her nipple
-hold the baby's body close to her body
-support the baby's whole body, not just the neck and shoulders
Show the mother how to help her baby to attach. She should:
-touch her baby's lips with her nipple
-wait until her baby's mouth is opened wide
-move her baby quickly onto her breast, aiming the infant's lower lip well below the nipple.
Look for signs of good attachment:
-more of areola visible above the baby's mouth
-mouth wide open
-lower lip turned outwards
-baby's chin touching breast
Look for signs of effective suckling (that is, slow, deep sucks, sometimes pausing

If the attachment or suckling is not good, try again. Then reassess.
If breast engorgement, express a small amount of breast milk before starting breastfeeding to soften
nipple area so that it is easier for the baby to attach.</label><item><label>Done</label><value>done</value></item><item><label>Not Done</label><value>not</value></item></select1></group></h:body></h:html>
